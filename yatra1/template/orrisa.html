            The temples and monuments of Orissa in India are among the most magnificent gems of religious architecture the world has ever produced. Soaring against the dark sky, clustered by the many hundreds in the ancient holy city of Bhubaneswar, protecting the precincts of small towns and villages, the temples of Orissa are natural museums of the sublime and the divine, as well as the visible manifestations of something strong and enduring which seems to sanctify the entire state. These places of beauty and devotion often still serve as centers of intense religious activity and fervent festivals, as well as of great artistic creativity.</p> </b>
