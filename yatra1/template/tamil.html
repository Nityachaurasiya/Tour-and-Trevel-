          second millennium. The evidence of early Dravidians comes from studying the Indo-Aryan culture, languages, and
          findings at many mounds, the preeminent of which are Mohenjodaro in Punjab and Harappa in Larkana District in
          Sind.</p>

  <p>Enjoying a long coastline with a large number of excellent beaches dotted along the shores of the Bay of Bengal is
    Tamilnadu. Tamilnadu is considered as the Gateway to South India. Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and the former
    French colony of Pondicherry are its neighbouring states. The river Kaveri sanctifies the land before forming a
    delta into the Bay of Bengal at Kaverpoopattinam (Poompuhar). Crabs play hide-and-seek by coming out of one burrow,
    and taking refuge in another. Sea gulls hover in the sky and then rest on the sails of the fishing boats. There are
    many more breathtaking sights that will please you and hold you spell bound in Tamil Nadu.</p>
